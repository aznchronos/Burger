## BurgerTime
A fun Team Fortress themed application of SQL database management that allows you to seemlessly add items and have it appear immediately.

## Motivation
This was created as a way for me to better understand and utilize Handlebars, Express and Node while having a few fun liberties with one of my all time favorite games.

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -
